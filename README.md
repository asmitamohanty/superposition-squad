# Q3 Hackathon @ USC, September 2025

This repo is refers to the [Qomputing Hackathon challenge](https://github.com/sandraalhames/Q-3-Qompute-2025). Here, we targeted to solve the **Track 2: Quantum Optimization for Impact - Knapsack problem.** 

### Description of the following files

`minimization_experiments.ipynb` 
- This file sets up the simulation of the quantum circuits & contains various experiments to determine the optimal value that minimizes the Hamiltonian cost function to solve the Knapsack optimization problem.
- Here, we have tried experiments with different minimization algorithms & penalty factors.
- Results: Our experiments show that we can achieve a maximum probability score of upto 92% with our minimizing algorithm to determine the optimal value.

`q3hack.ipynb`
- This file shows our final work demonstrated on simulators & real IBM Hardware.

Please find the pdf attached which summarizes the application of our optimization problem.
